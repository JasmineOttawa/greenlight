Pixr, Nov, 1995, 81 minutes   

In a world where toys are living things but pretend to be lifeless when humans are present,   
a group of toys, owned by a boy named Andy Davis,   
are caught off-guard when Andy's birthday party is moved up a week,   
as his family (including his mother and infant sister Molly) is preparing to move the following week.   
Andy's toys – including Bo Peep the shepherdess, Mr. Potato Head, Rex the dinosaur,   
Hamm the piggy bank and Slinky Dog – fear they will be replaced by new toys from the birthday.  
A pull-string cowboy doll named Sheriff Woody – the toys' leader and Andy's favorite toy –   
sends out army men, led by Sergeant, to spy on the party and report the gift results to the others via baby monitors.   
The toys are relieved when the party appears to end with none of them being replaced by new toys,   
but then Andy receives a surprise gift – a Buzz Lightyear action figure, who thinks he is a real space ranger.  

Buzz impresses the other toys with his various features, and Andy begins to favor him,   
making Woody feel abandoned. As Andy prepares for a family outing at Pizza Planet,   
his mother allows him to bring one toy. Fearing Andy will choose Buzz,   
Woody attempts to trap him behind a desk, but ends up accidentally knocking him out of a window.   
The other toys, except Bo Peep and Slinky, rebel against Woody,   
believing he did harm to Buzz out of jealousy. Before they can exact revenge,   
Andy takes Woody and leaves for Pizza Planet. When the family stops for gas,   
Woody finds that Buzz has hitched a ride on their van. They have a fight,   
only to find the family has left without them.   
They manage to make their way to the restaurant by stowing away on a pizza delivery truck.   
Buzz, still thinking he is a real space ranger, despite Woody's attempts to convince him otherwise,   
gets them stuck in a crane game, where they are won by Andy's toy-abusing neighbor, a boy named Sid Phillips.  

Woody attempts to escape from Sid's house, but Buzz,   
finally realizing he is a toy after watching a Buzz Lightyear TV ad and trying and failing to fly out a window,   
sinks into despondency. Sid plans to launch Buzz on a fireworks rocket,   
but his plans are delayed by a thunderstorm.   
Woody tells Buzz about the joy he can bring to Andy as a toy, restoring his confidence.   
The next day, Woody and Sid's mutant creature toys rescue Buzz just as Sid is about to launch the rocket   
and scare Sid into no longer abusing toys, and he runs into his house screaming in horror.  
Woody and Buzz leave just as Andy and his family drive away toward their new home.  

The duo tries to make it to the moving truck, but Sid's dog, Scud, sees them and gives chase.   
Buzz gets left behind while saving Woody from Scud,   
and Woody tries rescuing him with Andy's radio-controlled car (RC).   
Thinking that Woody is trying to get rid of RC as well, the other toys attack and toss him off the truck.   
Having evaded Scud, Buzz and RC retrieve Woody and continue to chase the truck.   
Upon seeing Woody and Buzz together on RC,   
the other toys realize their mistake and try to help them get back aboard,   
but RC's batteries become depleted, stranding them.   
Buzz realizes Sid's rocket is still strapped to his back,   
and they ignite it, hurtling them toward the truck.   
Woody manages to throw RC into the truck before they soar into the air,   
and Buzz opens his wings to free himself from the rocket before it explodes,   
gliding with Woody to land safely into a box in the van, right next to Andy.   
Andy is delighted to see his favorite toys again.

On Christmas Day, at their new house,  
Woody and Buzz stage another reconnaissance mission to prepare for the new toy arrivals.   
One of the toys is Mrs. Potato Head, much to Mr. Potato Head's delight.   
As Woody jokingly asks what might be worse than Buzz,   
they discover Andy's new gift is a puppy, and the two share a worried smile.


+  玩具角色  

《玩具总动员》主人公巴斯光年和胡迪是两个全新设计的玩具，  
虽说《玩具总动员2》中设定胡迪和翠丝、  
红心在剧中都是50年代大受欢迎的儿童节目“胡迪牛仔秀”的角色。——但这是影片中虚拟的。  
不过电影中其他的大部分玩具角色都大有来头，  
像“蛋头先生”（POTATO HEAD）是孩子宝1952年发明的第一款成功玩具，  
首次在电视上做广告，《老友记》第一集中，Rachel就是因为未婚夫长得像蛋头先生而逃婚的。  

也有耍大牌的玩具公司，就像美泰并不授予初出茅庐的皮克斯公司使用芭比娃娃的请求，  
当然到了《玩具总动员》红遍天下，2010年出到第三部的时候，  
芭比娃娃和她帅男友就双双出现在了“演员”阵容中，而且是推动情节发展的主要角色！  

+ 开始十分钟我有些后悔了，台词有点多，光是画面不能诠释得很清楚，  
  听不懂台词的小朋友会比较辛苦，以至于我有时要来点画外音 

乔布斯最大的贡献除了苹果，还有一个皮克斯。  
《米老鼠》给了动画片声音，《白雪公主》给了动画片色彩，而《玩具总动员》则给了动画片3D，  
更重要的，《玩总》系列，也给了拯救一词，最伟大的精神内核。  
深入浅出地把一个丰厚的词，赋予了最生动的解读方式，  
并以童话式的温柔分享着人世间最温存的生命经验，原来，读懂生活，  
不需要太多道貌岸然的说教，有时候，只需要美国式的微微一笑

所有玩具们的精神危机就是总有一天会被主人遗弃，失去被宠爱和利用的价值。  
《玩具总动员》的每一集里都有一个或几个玩具失去主人的宠爱而被忽略，  
甚至被丢弃或变卖，于是几乎每一集里，都展现了一个完美的有关玩具的“自我救赎”。  
拯救自己，一向是个积极向上而充满刺激的励志桥段，  
于是，皮克斯公司仅仅用几段电脑动画就给全世界上了最生动的人生鼓动课，  
这效果，比起周立波陈安之要高明许多倍。  

励志的方式有好多种，皮克斯公司这一种，无疑带有美国式的幽默和生动，  
它可以如此风趣地把枯燥的理论上升到童话级的丝丝入扣津津有味上来，  
成就了世界级的领悟。也正因如此，我们不喜欢孔乙已贾宝玉，更喜欢把目光留驻到唐老鸭米老鼠身上。  
小时候喜欢狮子辛巴，喜欢铁臂阿童木，长大了，居然还是会喜欢伍迪，  
喜欢伍迪和巴斯光年，不仅是怀旧感在做怪，更多的，  
我们喜欢一种未泯的童贞里那些纯朴时光和时光之下悄然流走的动感青春。  
直到，我们童话般微笑着老去。
