1, what is it with boys  
2, three stage of boys  
== 0-6  : mother  
== 6-13 : father  
   Five fathering essentials:  
   . start early. fathers who physically care for their babies start to get fascinated and very in tune with them- it's called engrossment.  
     don't settle for being a klutz around babies.  
   . make time  
   . show your love  
   . lighten up  
   . havey down  
== 14-adulthood : male mentor, involved in community  
Fathers and fourteen-year-old sons can get a bit intense with each other. if someone else can assist with the male role at this age, dads and sons can relax a little.  
some wonderful movies : Searching for Bobby Fisher; Finding Forrester; The Run of the Country.  

Traditional societies depended for their survival on raising competent and responsible young men. It was a life-and-death issue, never left to chance.  
They developed very proactive programs for doing this. And the processes involved the whole adult community in a conerted effort.  
- A Lakota Initiation  
- The story of Nat, Stan, and the Motorbike  
- overcoming boys' tendency toward arrogance  
  Just loving your kids isn't enough, some toughness is necessary.  
  One good strategy is to have boys involved in service to others.   
- enlisting the help of others  
  a fourteen-yea-old is far from ready to just be "out there", there have to be others to act as a bridge, and this is what mentors do.  
  It really helps to belong to a strong social group  
  You need to have these kinds of friends to provide what uncles and aunts used to, Ideally they will make your kids welcome in their homes, "kick their butts" when it's called for,  
and a listening ear when things at home are a little intense. You can do same to their kids too, Teenagers are quite enjoyable when they are not your own.  
- what is there is no mentor available?  
  If we don't have a community for kids to belong to, they will make their own.  
- Gender difference are real!  
  
3, testosterone!  
- teenage boys and driving  
- each boy is unique  
  a good parent of a boy understands TNT (testosterone needing tutoring)  
- why boys scuffle and fight  
- boys need order  
   who's in charge? what are the rules? will those rules be fairly enforced?  
- the key word is structure  
  Boys feel insecure and in danger is there isn't enough structure in a situation.  
  If no one is in charge, they begin jostling with each other to establish the pecking order.  
  success with boys means accepting their nature while directing it in good ways.  
  If you know what you are dealing with, it's a whole lot easier, and you don't need to blame anyone - just help them find a better way.   
- how did male and female difference come about?    
- the links between sex and aggression  
- guiding the "high Drive" boys   

4, how boy's and girl's brain differ  
- danger: Sexiam alert  性别歧视
- helping the brain grow
  . How to figure out people's feelings from the expressions on their faces
  . how to make friends and join in a game or conversation
  . how to read his own body signals - for example, to know when he is getting angry and needs to walk away from a situation
- boys are not inferior - just different
- starting schools: why should boys start later

5, what dads can do  
- Fighting to be a dad, from day 1  
- Reviving a lost art  
- kids learn your attitudes  
- kids learn to love by watching you  
- kids learn to feel by watching you  
- mirror neurons  
  everything kids see, they take into their brains and are inclined to repeat  
- whatever happens in your marriage, don't divorce your kids    
- rough-and-tumble games: what's really going on?  
- The big male lesson: knowing when to stop  
  always say "can you handle it?" rather than " will you keep the rules?" which sounds kind of prissy!   
  No boy is going to say No to a question like "can you handle it?"  
  For a mararige to survive, it is sometimes necessary for partners to stand nose to nose, while saying some really honest stuff, I cakk this "trutuh time" -  
  the time when differences that have been bilding up get aired and cleared away.  
- Teaching boys to respect women  
  one day when a boy realize he is taller than his mother, being respectful talking to his mother in the kichen, what would a dad do ?  
- What fathers do  
  get a ride to airport by 3 young men  
- is it ADD or DDD - Dad Deficiency Disorder  
  ADD - Attention Deficit Disorder  
- Do I have to have all the answers  
  Parenthood is all about learning from mistakes, that's how you learn.  
  Family life is a work in progress, you only get in trouble if you have to be right and you have to show them who's boss. If you are human, it goes much better.  
- Finding the balance is hard  
  It's okay to get unpopular with your kids once or twice a day.  
  "why is it so hard to hate you"  
- Off Topic: Dads and Daughters  
  Don't ever, whatever you do, criticize her looks, her weight, or any aspect of her appearance. not ever  
  If she knows from you that she is interesting, intelligent, and worthwhile, boys have to measure up to this - which eliminate 80 percent of them right off the bat.   
- letter from a father  
  school angel-home devil  
- Dads do matter  

6, mothers and sons  
-- learning through consequences
   Discipline works by cooperation. natural consequences and a sense of fairness are your tools. Negotiate with him, you can't make a teenager do things by force -
   but you provide so many services that your bargaining power is huge!
-- Getting boys to do house work
   As a general rule, cook and clean and tidy for your late-teenage son only if you want him to stay at home for the rest of your life
   When a teenage boy experiencing the pride to being useful to his family, his relatives, and to the wider community of people who like and respect him, he never loses that feeling. 
   a chance to get close - males like to talk "sideways" rather than face-to-face. 

7, healthy sexuality
- There are 3 kinds of attraction
  liking: is a mental spark, shared beliefs and preferences, and the connection with another mind
  loving: is tender, warm, melting, and heartfelt emotion
  lusting: is spicy, hot, ungry, aching, tingling
  Never intentionally harm or misuse somebody else. Young people need lots of warmth, positive support, and good practical information - and a chance to grow up before becoming sexually active.
- the essential goodness of sex
  sexual learning includes two parts: the physical details of lovemaking and the much bigger questions of attitudes and values.
  The really potent information about sex is the attitude you bring to it. Be clear with your boys that there is good sex (respectful, happt, close, careful about pregnancy and STDs)
  and bad sex (using others selfishly)
- how people get hurt when sex isn't honored
  Boy culture is just the blind leading the blind so much of the time, and behavior usually sinks to the lowest denominator. Robert Bly calls it a "sibilng society" with no elders.
  It takes skill to steer things in a better direction in a group situation. kids can learn these skills only if they have seen someone else handling a similiar situation. 
- Rite of Passage
  A ceremony for honoring the start of adolescense and giving sexuality a positive start
- Someone to talk to
- how boys feel about girls
  They can invest a real spiritual intensity into idealizing a particular girl as the epitome of everything noble and pure.
- how boys shut down their bodies
  Boys want to feel alive in their bodies. that's why they like music with a heavy beat, and why they love activity, speed and danger.
  They instanctly know can help them break into manhood. A boy who enjoys his body and can hug his mom, dad, and sisters, often has many ways to feel good -
  dancing, drumming, or playing sports for the buzz of the game itself. For these boys, sex carries a little less weight - it's a pleasure, rather than an obsession.
- keeping things open and positive
  Demand maturity - with good humor. If you notice your sons sniggering or reacting in a silly way to an incident on TV or in the conversation, don't just let it go - ask them about it,
  and fill out their understanding. But end with a joke or a laugh. Give things a more positive spin. The antidote to "creepiness" is an infusion of warmth, humor and openness.

  If boys and girls are encouraged in school ot youth groups to talk and mix and have friendships what are not "dates", they can learn more about the opposite sex without the
  self-consciousness of "going steady" (稳定，情侣关系), they can graduate in friendship first and major in romance later.
